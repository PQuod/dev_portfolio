I'm **Lucie**, a french web developer, and this is my internet shack.

 You'll find some stuff here about my [*work*]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang}}/work.html) and the sites I designed for others, my own personal [*projects*]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang}}/projects.html), a [*log*]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang}}/log.html) gathering thoughts and notes about my developing journey and links to all the great [*places*]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang}}/places.html) I've discovered so far around the web.

This site has an english and a french version, and you can switch between them two on the upper left side of the screen.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/PQuod) or [Codepen](https://codepen.io/pquod), and if you want to chat, feel free to send me a mail: **l.desaubliaux [at] gmail.com**.

To know more, visit [*about*]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang}}/about.html).
