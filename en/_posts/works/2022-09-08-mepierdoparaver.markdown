Carlos Bernal Barrera's website, featuring his work. The site is built with Jekyll and its content is fully accessible to its owner *via* the headless CMS Forestry. Carlos being Colombian living in France, we wanted to play around with his two countries. The site is bilingual, with a toggle allowing to switch between languages from any page. A script automatically changes the design, between light or dark mode, in accordance with Colombia night/day cycle.
