Deep Music Anomaly gathers creative writing texts written during a workshop with the writer Samuel Rochery, at Maison de la Po√©sie de Rennes. It is hosted on [neocities.org](https://neocities.org/) and its aesthetics are inspired by the early web and handmade websites made during the 90's and 2000's. It is written mainly in oldschool html and css. A little bit of js was used to create a fake chatroom.
