*Internet Exploreur* was a website displaying creative writing and featuring more than 30 different artists. The main stake of the site was to be very accessible for the widest range of person possible. Its design is intended to be minimalist but elegant. Being text-based, it was essential to offer tools for users to display the texts in the way that suited them the most. Users can alternate between serif and sans-serif fonts, change the font size or switch between dark and light mode. The owners of the website having no time anymore to take care of the contributions, the site has ceased to publish, but an archive is still accessible on [Github](https://github.com/PQuod/InternetExploreur).
