La Guerrière is an associative art gallery based in Rennes (FR). The website displays past and current exhibitions and different resources about the featured artists' works. For now, the website's content is added *via* Github, but an access through a headless CMS is soon to be implemented, in order to facilitate content management for the four members of the team.
