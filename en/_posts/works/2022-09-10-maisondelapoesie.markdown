Maison de la Poésie de Renne's website. Built with Jekyll and deployed with Netlify, allowing its users to manage easily a content that needs to be daily updated. The site was built with a desire to be very clear, readable and text-based only. The site also features the management of the association's library, with a database associated to it, built with Airtable, editable through custom forms *via* an admin space. (I wrote something about having a static but dynamic website [there]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang}}/log.html/#linking-a-static-website-to-a-database)).
