Ultimate Biblio 3000 is the current shape of a very long-term artistic series I initiated in 2010, when I was still in art school.

One of the main axis of my artisitic work is about exploring thouhgts organisation and layouts, often through the prism of literature and how what we read arranges itself in our brains and becomes personal memories.

Since 2008, I list every book I read and write down quotations I find interesting, beautiful, intriguing or just that I feel like keeping a record somewhere could be useful for later.

In 2010, I followed a first trail about ripping off everything edition-related from my books and seeing how they relate to each other in my personal bookshelves.

In 2012, I studied synesthesis, which appears to the way I personnally recollect books, and drew a giant 3D constellation of all my readings for 4 years, depicting the visually how I felt books were organising themselves inside thoughts.

Since then, I followed several leads to develop these researches, publishing color charts about books or trying to build secret rhizomes in public libraries. Meanwhile, I also explored new ways to represent thoughts outside of books and readings. 

But I've been keeping on collecting quotations, and I'm currently filling my 11th notebook with them. I've kept on thinking for all those years about a platform somewhere, a site or an app, reorganizing these quotations, these books, to build different thoughts maps, nets, rhizomes. For other purposes, I learned to code, first simple websites in html and css, then more complex ways of organising things through databases, php and mysql for example. I tried several times to begin this platform, but each time got stuck because it only remained a static numeric copy of the shapes I had already built IRL. 

It's been a year now that I've studied a bit of data visualization, first by dicovering the work of Johanna Drucker and several other artsits and researchers, then by discovering developers interested in showing data and how they're organized in a more organic way. This Ultimate Biblio 3000 project began then to have a more concrete shape in my own mind. It became clearer why this new shape was meant to be written in code, and how relevant it could be to help this whole reflection to progress.

The current shape of UB3000 V1 remains quite rough. It still displays things in a quite linear way. My wishes for the following versions are to find more organic, subjective and spatial ways to displays all those bits of literature and thoughts, and to add a more participative side to the project as well. 

Another note in this journal will be written very soon mainly focused on UB3000 itself, this first versions and my perspectives for following versions I hope will come soon...
