These last few months I just had second thoughts about my love for static websites.

For two years, JAMstack has nearly been an automatism for me when building "straightforward" "classic" websites. I.e. sites made to display articles organized in pages or categories, without the need of a database or any other server-dependant functions. I loved static solutions or tools for their flexibility, their adaptability, their lightness and their speed. It was also often the most economical solutions for clients with low budgets (I often work for small associations or independant artists who can't afford - and don't really need - a very expensive website), for with github pages and headless CMS like netlify, they only had to pay for a domain, when the site was done. To sum up, static websites perfectly fulfilled their needs in terms of "showcase-websites".

The only thing that made me uncomfortable is that in order to deliver a convenient user experience in terms of content mangement, I had to implement headless CMS to those sites. In most cases, the clients don't really want to manage their websites writing articles in markdown and having to deal with github or an FTP.
