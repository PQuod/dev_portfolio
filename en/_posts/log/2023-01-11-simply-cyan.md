I discovered Jekyll almost 3 years ago now, and the very first site I developped with this ssg was **Internet Exploreur**; which unfortunately isn't online anymore, but an archive is accessible [here](https://pquod.github.io/InternetExploreur/).

With Quentin Leclerc, my colleague and friend, we built, during the first french lockdown, a website allowing dozens of authors to post unpublished creative writing texts. Thanks to Candice Labrousse and Robinson Lacotte, who gave us great pieces of advice about design and good practices for that kind of work, we built and launched Internet Exploreur in march 2020.

Its maintenance was too time-consuming for Quentin who decided to stop updating it in march 2022.

In order to allow others to be able to use the researches we made to build a clear, adaptable and accessible website, I decided to make a jekyll thme out of it.

Its Github repo is [here](https://github.com/PQuod/simply-cyan-theme), a demo is accessible [there](https://pquod.github.io/simply-cyan-demo/) and its Gem page is [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/simply-cyan).

I had a great time trying to document it as thoroughly as possible (see the `readme.md` file on the repo page). Feel free to contact me if you notice any lack of information in this documentation, or if you think about any other useful functionality that could be added to improve this theme. I'd be glad to keep on working on it in order to make it more complete, useful and adaptable for your projects!
