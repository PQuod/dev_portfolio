Just a quick one to write about the very first version of what is called temporarily my **personal timeline**, and which is supposed to become the place where everything I make is gathered, wether it is code, litterature or visual arts.

I pretty much based its graphisms upon this webdev portfolio, for I love how simple and clear it is. We will see how it evolves.

For now, it is just a quick bunch of posts depicting my most recent activities. I'm still trying to figure out a way to articulate everything together while keeping it as simple as possible. I have to make it clear and readable, while being kind of thourough with more complex projects made of several smaller pieces all referencing to each other...

I've talked about it a little in my [winter plans](https://pquod.github.io/dev_portfolio/fr/log.html#plans-pour-l-hiver), and about how I wanted it to be a public WIP, displaying each steps whenever I work upon it, whatever graphical or technical state it is in.

It is online [here](https://pquod.github.io/personal_timeline/), and will soon replace my "official" artistic website [here](luciedesaubliaux.fr/). I'll keep this log updated with further improvements.
